# python-challenge
This project we were asked to manipulate csv files.
I did so with pandas so that I organize and get specific values without relying loops
In PyPoll:
    - main.py contains the code which has written profitInfo.txt
In PyBank
    - main.py contains the code which has written electionResults.txt

Both .csv files store the data analyzed
